# Mining Segmentation
Computational execution of mining: partitioning the search space (nonce) for distributed mining. Allows mining to be parallelized and distributed across multiple nodes.

## Block Segmentation Algorithm for Efficient Mining

To enhance energy efficiency and enable the participation of small computational nodes in solving high-difficulty blocks (e.g., using SHA256d), we propose a segmentation-based mining algorithm. This approach allows the decomposition of a large mining workload into smaller segments that can be distributed across a cluster of lightweight cloud instances.

Algorithm Overview:

1. Input Block Parameters:
   - Retrieve current block data, difficulty, target hash.

2. Hash Range Partitioning:
   - Divide the total nonce/hash space into equal segments.
   - Assign each segment to a different node in the cluster.

3. Dynamic Allocation:
   - Adjust segment size based on each node's performance and hashrate.
   - Use AI to reassign ranges to more efficient nodes.

4. Asynchronous Mining:
   - Nodes mine independently on their assigned range.
   - Results (partial solutions) are streamed to the master node.

5. Aggregation & Validation:
   - The master node aggregates results.
   - Validates any hash that meets or surpasses the target difficulty.

6. Adaptive Feedback Loop:
   - Nodes that consistently underperform are reassigned simpler tasks or supported via redundancy.

Benefits:

- Enables collaborative block solving using low-power cloud VMs.
- Optimizes resource allocation per task segment.
- Dynamically adapts to network conditions and mining difficulty.

To do:

- AI for range assignment decision (scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.).
- Implement master node → distribute loads via WebSocket or ZeroMQ.

## Distributed Architecture: Master-Worker (Python 3)

The Master Node:

- divides the nonce space into segments

- sends segments to Workers via TCP

- receives found hashes and validates them

Worker Nodes:

- receive the segment

- mine independently

- send valid hashes to the Master

### Base design structure

Mining Segmentation basic design and Python 3 source code.

                      /block_segmentation/
                      ├── master.py      # Master Node
                      └── worker.py      # Miner Node

Project folder: "block_segmentation".

Start Master in terminal for local tests:

                     python3 master.py

Start Workers in different terminals:

                     python3 worker.py

Upcoming extensions:

- AI to assign segments (based on historical speed)
- Security over sockets (e.g., TLS or SSH tunnel)
- Reconnection and fault tolerance
- Web dashboard for live mining monitoring
- P2P support instead of centralized architecture
