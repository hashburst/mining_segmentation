# Mining Segmentation
Computational execution of mining: partitioning the search space (nonce) for distributed mining. Allows mining to be parallelized and distributed across multiple nodes.

## Block Segmentation Algorithm for Efficient Mining

To enhance energy efficiency and enable the participation of small computational nodes in solving high-difficulty blocks (e.g., using SHA256d), we propose a segmentation-based mining algorithm. This approach allows the decomposition of a large mining workload into smaller segments that can be distributed across a cluster of lightweight cloud instances.

Algorithm Overview:

1. Input Block Parameters:
   - Retrieve current block data, difficulty, target hash.

2. Hash Range Partitioning:
   - Divide the total nonce/hash space into equal segments.
   - Assign each segment to a different node in the cluster.

3. Dynamic Allocation:
   - Adjust segment size based on each node's performance and hashrate.
   - Use AI to reassign ranges to more efficient nodes.

4. Asynchronous Mining:
   - Nodes mine independently on their assigned range.
   - Results (partial solutions) are streamed to the master node.

5. Aggregation & Validation:
   - The master node aggregates results.
   - Validates any hash that meets or surpasses the target difficulty.

6. Adaptive Feedback Loop:
   - Nodes that consistently underperform are reassigned simpler tasks or supported via redundancy.

Benefits:

- Enables collaborative block solving using low-power cloud VMs.
- Optimizes resource allocation per task segment.
- Dynamically adapts to network conditions and mining difficulty.

To do:

- AI for range assignment decision (scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.).
- Implement master node → distribute loads via WebSocket or ZeroMQ.

## Distributed Architecture: Master-Worker (Python 3)

The Master Node:

- divides the nonce space into segments

- sends segments to Workers via TCP

- receives found hashes and validates them

Worker Nodes:

- receive the segment

- mine independently

- send valid hashes to the Master
